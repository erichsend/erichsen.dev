### The Goal

- Be able to automatically assign a subdomain under `erichsen.dev` to any LoadBalancers deployed in kubernetes with External IPs.

The commit that I'll be describing below can be found [here](https://github.com/erichsend/api.erichsen.dev/commit/7b2ab727c30b48c83c36045829dd94829cdeba5e)

### Deployment

First I'll go into the current state of DNS management, followed by the setup of ExternalDNS, and ending with the delegation of subdomains to Linode for management.

#### Beginning State

Both the Hybrid Kong and KIC deployments surface a LoadBalancer type service that triggers Linode to provision a Load Balancer and assign an external IP address with proper port mapping allowing the service to be accessed on the standard `443` port for HTTPS when using the ExternalIPs of these LoadBalancers.

This is great, but since DNS is not automatically managed, it means every time the LoadBalancers are re-deployed (admittedly not often), a new ExternalIP is assigned aand I need to manually go to AWS Route53 and manually re-set the `A Record` for `kic.erichsen.dev` or `api.erichsen.dev` depending on which changed.

ExternalDNS will allow me to assign a DNS name via annotations directly to the Kong `proxy` services, meaning no more manual updates when the ExternalIP changes for a LoadBalancer.

#### Setting Up ExternalDNS

I begin with the familiar process of creating a directory to hold the source files for the ArgoCD Application that will manage the ExternalDNS deployment.

```
mkdir external-dns
touch external-dns/Chart.yaml
touch external-dns/values.yaml
```

In `external-dns/Chart.yaml` I add the ExternalDNS dependency and pin the versions to the App Version of the ExternalDNS Chart
```
apiVersion: v2
name: external-dns
version: 6.14.3
appVersion: 0.13.3
description: external-dns
sources:
  - https://github.com/bitnami/charts
type: application
dependencies:
  - name: external-dns
    version: 6.14.3
    repository: https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
```

With the dependency defined I can now have helm download the external-dns chart to confirm it is declared correctly:
```
❯ cd external-dns && helm dep update
...
Saving 1 charts
Downloading external-dns from repo https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
```

Now I just need to add my values overrides in `external-dns/values.yaml`. Thankfully I am using Linode which, for better or worse, doesn't have much to configure, unlike, say, the AWS Route53 provider.
```
external-dns:
  provider: linode
  linode:
    secretName: linode-api-key
```

I also at this point manually generated a Linode API key, created a new namespace for `external-dns`, and added the API key to a `linode-api-key` secret in the `external-dns` namespace.

```
TOKEN=<linode-api-key>
❯ kubectl create namespace external-dns
namespace/external-dns created

❯ k create secret generic linode-api-key -n external-dns --from-literal=linode_api_token=$TOKEN
secret/linode-api-key created
```

Last, I created the new Argo App definition, which again is pretty boilerplate and can be seen [here](https://github.com/erichsend/api.erichsen.dev/commit/7b2ab727c30b48c83c36045829dd94829cdeba5e#diff-9d0ac0a2b3101e9bae02dc498c42cf4a484db4562dc937243cb150044b490b3eR1-R19)

#### Consuming ExternalDNS in Kong Proxy Deployments

With the ExternalDNS operator ready to be deployed as an ArgoCD Application, I just need to provide the proper annotations to the LoadBalancer Services fronting the Hybrid Kong and KIC dataplanes.

Since the `proxy` service defined in the Kong helm chart is used for the dataplanes in both the KIC and Hybrid deployments, both deployments are configured the same way: by adding the ExternalDNS annotations to the `proxy` overrides in the `konnect-kic-dps.yaml` and `konnect-hybrid-dps.yaml`.

e.g. in `konnect-hybrid-dps.yaml`:
```
  proxy:
    annotations:
      external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: api.erichsen.dev
```

#### Testing the ExternalDNS Operator

Once all of the above configuration was complete, I [committed](https://github.com/erichsend/api.erichsen.dev/commit/7b2ab727c30b48c83c36045829dd94829cdeba5e) the change and refreshed/synced the ArgoCD 'app of apps' to pick up the new `external-dns` application, and then synced that new application followed by the `konnect-hybrid-dps` and `konnect-kic-dps` applications.

Everything from the cluster/ArgoCD perspective was healthy, and I confirmed that ExternalDNS did it's job by having a look with the linode cli.

```
❯ linode-cli domains list
┌─────────┬──────────────────┬────────┬────────┬────────────────────┐

└──────────┴──────┴──────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴─────────┴──────────┴────────┘
```

#### Delegating from Route53 to Linode Domains

Even though Linode's Name Servers have the records now, they are not yet authoritative. That is because `erichsen.dev` is fully delegated to Route53 and there is not yet any further delegation of subdomains.

So now for hopefully the last time, I go to Route53 to make a manual records update to records pertaining to `api.erichsen.dev` and `kic.erichsen.dev`.

- Delete the existing `A Record` for each of the two subdomains
- Add a new NS Record for each subdomain. Each NS Record is identical:
  ```
  ns1.linode.com
  ns2.linode.com
  ns3.linode.com
  ns4.linode.com
  ns5.linode.com
  ```

That's it! Now anyone querying for `api.erichsen.dev` and `kic.erichsen.dev` will be getting the results that ExternalDNS has configured in Linodes' Domain Name Servers.

### Wrapping Up

After waiting for DNS propagation to take place, I run a `dig` and see we are now using linode Name Servers which themselves hold records pointing to the ExternalIPs of the linode LoadBalancers. The A Record points to the LB external IP address, and the TXT record indicates it's being managed by ExternalDNS.

```
> dig api.erichsen.dev [TXT|NS|SOA]

...

api.erichsen.dev.       21600   IN      A       139.144.255.29
api.erichsen.dev.       21600   IN      TXT     "\"heritage=external-dns,external-dns/owner=default,external-dns/resource=service/konnect-kong/konnect-kong-kong-proxy\""
api.erichsen.dev.       21600   IN      NS      ns1.linode.com.
api.erichsen.dev.       21600   IN      NS      ns5.linode.com.
api.erichsen.dev.       21600   IN      NS      ns3.linode.com.
api.erichsen.dev.       21600   IN      NS      ns2.linode.com.
api.erichsen.dev.       21600   IN      NS      ns4.linode.com.
api.erichsen.dev.       21600   IN      SOA     ns1.linode.com. admin.erichsen.dev. 2021000012 14400 14400 1209600 86400
```

And last but certainly not least, I confirmed that the APIs still work:

```
❯ curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" "https://api.erichsen.dev"
200
❯ curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" "https://kic.erichsen.dev"
200
```

### Next Steps

- Automate secret management with ExternalSecrets
- Automate cluster setup with Terraform
