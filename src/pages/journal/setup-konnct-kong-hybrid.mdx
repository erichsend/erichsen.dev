### Goal

- Deploy a Kong gateway as an ArgoCD Application from the Kong helm charts
- Host and manage the gateway configuration in Konnect
- Access the gateway proxy service via `api.erichsen.dev`

### Deploying

I'll do this in several steps:
- Get required information from Konnect
- Build the konnect-kong application in the cluster
- Deploy the gateway
- Set up DNS and HTTPS

#### Gathering Konnect Information

- Logging into my account at cloud.konghq.com I go to Runtime Manager and select my default runtime group
- The runtime instance list is empty so I click "create new runtime instance"
- On the next page I select the tile for Kubernetes instructions

The script that is generated automatically created a keypair for my dp-cp communication and uploaded the public key to Konnect.

I copy the cert information and the generated helm values into 3 files for the nest step:
- `tls.crt` containing my public key that was also pinned in Konnect
- `tls.key` containing my private key that Konnect does not have
- `values.yaml` containing runtime group information required by the dataplanes to reach konnect

##### Building the Konnect-Kong Application



#### Deploying the Gateway


#### Configuring DNS and HTTPS
