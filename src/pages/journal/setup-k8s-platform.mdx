### The Goal

- Be able to surface API's to the internet at `api.erichsen.dev`
- Host services on Kubernetes
- Nearly 100% automation with GitOps
- Production-like (or maybe production-lite is a better phrase)
- Cheap to run

### The setup

- Kubernetes will be Linode Kubernetes Engine - it's cheap and uncomplicated.
- Linode also offers automation for adding block storage for persistent volume claims, and creating load balancers for that service type
- ArgoCD will manage my GitOps requirements

#### Setting up the cluster

I requested a new cluster via their console. Linode is offering a $100 credit over 2 months, so I want to stay close to $50/month.

```
2 Shared CPU Linode 4GB nodes @ $20/node/month
2 planned Load Balancers @ $10/month (one for kong hybrid, one for kic)
2 Planned 10GB Storage Volumes @ $1/month

Estimated Cost: $62/month
```

I will be sure I can spin these up/down easily before my $100 credit runs out.

Next I attached firewalls to the kubernetes nodes. I followed the advice offered in [this support answer from linode](https://www.linode.com/community/questions/19155/securing-k8s-cluster) and applied the following rules:

```
TCP port 10250 from 192.168.128.0/17 Accept, Kubelet health checks
UDP port 51820 from 192.168.128.0/17 Accept, Wireguard tunneling for kubectl proxy
TCP port 179 from 192.168.128.0/17 Accept, Calico BGP traffic
TCP/UDP port 30000 - 32767 192.168.128.0/17 Accept, NodePorts for workload Services
TCP All Ports All IPv4/All IPv6 Drop, Block all other TCP traffic
UDP All Ports All IPv4/All IPv6 Drop, Block all other UDP traffic
ICMP All Ports All IPv4/All IPv6 Drop, Block all ICMP traffic
```

#### Setting up ArgoCD

I want to have all of my apps and charts in a single repository, including overrides to 3rd party charts. Therefore, I chose the 'app of apps' pattern using ArgoCD. This pattern as well as other useful information about setting up ArgoCD can be found [on this padok.fr post](https://www.padok.fr/en/blog/kubernetes-cluster-gitops).

The 'App of Apps' is an argo application that points to a directory of kubternetes resources, which also happen to be ArgoCD Application CRDs.

It will work like this:
- Create an "api.erichsen.dev" repository with an `argocd/apps` folder to contain Application definitions
- Add an app called 'argocd apps' to the `argocd/apps` directory, with its source definition pointing to the same repo and directory
  ```
    source:
      path: argocd/apps/
      repoURL: 'https://github.com/erichsend/api.erichsen.dev'
  ```
- Manually Install ArgoCD on the cluster (usining minimal mode to save resources)
- Manually apply the 'App of Apps' application to the cluster

#### Wrapping Up

I started up the argocd dashboard using the cli utility since I'm not running the ui in the cluster.

As a test, I push a new application to the `argocd-apps` directory of my source repository, and see it appear in ArgoCD. I then removed the commit from the repository.

# Next Steps
- Add Kong proxy in hybrid mode using Konnect for a Control Plane
- Add a KIC and replicate the konnect-defined routes as native k8s ingresses
- Automate DNS and Certificate management
