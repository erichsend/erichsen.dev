title: Deploying the Echo Service behind Kong Proxies
description: "A simple service used for testing gateway configuration"

To recap the current state:
- ArgoCD can automatically render and apply helm charts based on Application definitions in github
- A Konnect Runtime Group is managing configuration for a Kong proxy service deployed to the cluster and available at api.erichsen.dev
- A Kong Ingress Controller for Kubernetes is managing another Kong proxy service available at `kic.erichsen.dev`, and reporting its configuration to Konnect

What is missing is a service to begin proxying traffic to. 

Since some of the plugins I would like to eventually use will transform the request in the gateway, it will be useful to have a simple 'echo' service to see what exactly the upstream service received from the gateway.

### The Goal

- Deploy a new 'echo' service with a new custom chart and Application definition
- Configure the service to be reachable on both the Konnect hybrid kong and kic deployments

### Deploying

The image to deploy will be the Echo Server from `gcr.io/kubernetes-e2e-test-images/echoserver`.

I'll be starting a new helm chart for this just to document the process. In the future, the Echo Server image could be replaced with an image that I build, and the chart should be very similar to the one I'm building now.

The commit containing the new chart and application can be found [here](https://github.com/erichsend/api.erichsen.dev/commit/9edc95ff03579c854ac786ec6d47c13c718fb364u).

#### Creating the Helm Chart

In my `api.erichsen.dev` repository root, I start a new helm project:

```
helm create echo-service
```

This leaves me with the default helm project structure and files:

```
echo-service/
  Chart.yaml
  values.yaml
  templates/
    NOTES.txt
    _helpers.tpl
    deployment.yaml
    hpa.yaml
    ingress.yaml
    service.yaml
    serviceaccount.yaml
    tests
    tests/
      test-connection.yaml
  charts/
```

From here it was a matter of mostly removing what I didn't plan to use, and updating the values file.

##### Deletes
- Deleted `echo-service/templates/NOTES.txt` to tidy up
- Deleted hpa.yaml - I do not plan to worry about autoscaling this service
- Deleted serviceaccount.yaml - I do not plan to use a serviceaccount for now

##### Changes
- Removed many unused keys from the values file, including imagePullSecrets, serviceAccount, podSecurityContext, securityContext, resources, and autoscaling
- Removed all parts of `deployment.yaml` correlating to the properties removed from values.yaml
- Updated the image repository to `repository: gcr.io/kubernetes-e2e-test-images/echoserver`, and removed the tag to default to the chart AppVersion
- Changed the ingress section of values.yaml to include the following ingress values
```
ingress:
  enabled: true
  className: "kong"
  annotations:
    konghq.com/strip-path: 'true'
  hosts:
    - host: kic.erichsen.dev
      paths:
        - path: /
          pathType: ImplementationSpecific
  tls:
    - secretName: kic-erichsen-dev-tls
      hosts:
        - kic.erichsen.dev
```

With these changes, I have a minimal helm chart that will run the echo server on a single replica available on the path `/` for the host header of `kic.erichsen.dev`.

Additionally, since I have not set up the acme plugin for kic yet, I am supplying a server cert for `kic.erichsem.dev` as a manually-applied secret.


#### Deploying the Application

Since ArgoCD Applications are so similar, I just copy an existing app and change the path and application name.

Once all of these changes were committed, I was able to sync the `argo-apps` Application to detect the new `echo-service` Application. Syncing `echo-service` was successful as well.

Since I had previously pointed `kic.erichsen.dev` to the KIC proxy service LoadBalancer external IP, I could immediately `curl https://kic.erichsen.dev` to see the output of the service, with TLS working thanks to the manually applied certificate. 

### Wrapping Up

To complete the task, I manually created a gateway service and route in Konnect and confirmed I could access the echo service at `api.erichsem.dev` as well. It's becoming clear that I need to change my konnect configuration to DecK before long.

With this service in place, I can experiment with a number of Kong plugins and see the result of any applied request or response changes,

### Next Steps
- Refactor the konnect charts into a single chart
- Automate DNS management for both gateway deployments
- Automate certificate management for `kic.erichsen.dev`
