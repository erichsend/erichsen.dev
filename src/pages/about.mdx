My name is [David Erichsen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erichsend), and I'm currently a manager of software engineering at [Kong](https://konghq.com/).

The domain `erichsen.dev` exists for me to build and prototype things that I'm interested in, typically because it is tangential to something we're building on the Konnect SaaS.

Today, the domain consists of two parts
- `erichsen.dev` is this statically generated UI used to host my development journal
- `api.erichsen.dev` is a kubernetes-hosted API platform powered by Kong's Konnect SaaS product and running a multitude of experiments.
